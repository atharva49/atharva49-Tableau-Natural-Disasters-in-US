# Multi-Maps-Tableau | Natural Disasters Impacting Refineries

In this project, I aim to provide a comprehensive visual analysis of the impact of natural disasters on oil refinery operations across the United States. Leveraging data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and refinery locations from energy companies, I've created interactive visualizations using Tableau. These visualizations help communicate the complex relationships between natural disasters and refinery vulnerabilities, supporting data-driven decision-making for energy stakeholders.

## Key Objectives

1. **Visualize Natural Disaster Occurrences**: Map the locations and types of natural disasters, such as floods, hurricanes, and fires, across the United States between 2004 and 2015, using FEMA data.
2. **Identify Refinery Locations**: Pinpoint the locations of oil refineries, including their associated counties and states, based on refinery data from energy companies.
3. **Analyze Disaster Impact**: Uncover the top four natural disasters posing the greatest threat to refinery operations, enabling proactive planning and mitigation strategies.
4. **Create a Compelling Narrative**: Employ rhetorical techniques (emotional, logical, or ethical) to weave the visualizations into a cohesive story, communicating the significance of the findings and potential consequences for critical energy infrastructure.

## Data Sources

For this project, I utilize the following data sources:

1. **Natural Disaster Data**: An Excel file containing detailed information on natural disasters, including incident types, locations (counties/areas), and associated states, provided by FEMA.
2. **Refinery Data**: An Excel file listing the rankings of energy companies and their refinery locations, including refinery names, counties, and states.

## Tableau Visualizations

The project features the following Tableau visualizations that I have created:

The rhetoric used is emotional rhetoric. The main goal of a Tableau story is to communicate insights through a compelling narrative. By illustrating the connections between natural disasters and refineries and their geographical impacts, we can effectively convey the significance of these relationships. This visualization project aims to highlight how refineries located in disaster-prone areas are susceptible to certain natural disasters, emphasizing the need for proactive planning and preparation. Proper countermeasures are crucial to preventing potential disasters, such as explosions, which can have catastrophic consequences similar to the Fukushima nuclear reactor meltdown following a serious earthquake in Japan.
