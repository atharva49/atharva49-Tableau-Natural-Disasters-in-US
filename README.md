# Multi-Maps-Tableau | Natural Disasters Impacting Refineries
Through this project, I aim to provide a comprehensive visual analysis of the impact of natural disasters on oil refinery operations across the United States. By leveraging data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and refinery locations from energy companies, I have created interactive visualizations using Tableau. These visualizations enable me to effectively communicate the complex relationships between natural disasters and refinery vulnerabilities, supporting data-driven decision-making for energy stakeholders.


# Key Objectives

1.	Visualize Natural Disaster Occurrences: I map the locations and types of natural disasters, such as floods, hurricanes, and fires, across the United States between 2004 and 2015, using FEMA data.
2.	Identify Refinery Locations: I pinpoint the locations of oil refineries, including their associated counties and states, based on refinery data from energy companies.
3.	Analyze Disaster Impact: My analysis uncovers the top four natural disasters posing the greatest threat to refinery operations, enabling proactive planning and mitigation strategies.
4.	Create a Compelling Narrative: I employ rhetorical techniques (emotional, logical, or ethical) to weave the visualizations into a cohesive story, communicating the significance of the findings and potential consequences for critical energy infrastructure.

# Data Sources

For this project, I utilize the following data sources:

1.	Natural Disaster Data: An Excel file containing detailed information on natural disasters, including incident types, locations (counties/areas), and associated states, provided by FEMA.
2.	Refinery Data: An Excel file listing the rankings of energy companies and their refinery locations, including refinery names, counties, and states.

# Tableau Visualizations

The project features the following Tableau visualizations that I have created:

# 1. Natural Disasters Map: An interactive map displaying the locations and types of natural disasters across the United States, with filtering options for states and incident types.

# 3. Oil Refinery - States Map: A focused view on the states where the selected energy company has refineries, highlighting the relevant natural disasters in those areas.

The states in which Exxonmobil Refining & Supply Co has refineries are:
Texas, Louisiana, Illinois, Montana

From analyzing this, we can say all disasters that are impacting a particular state for example, Louisiana – Flood, Coastal Storm and Montana – Fire, Hurricane.

The rhetoric used is emotional rhetoric. The reason for employing emotional rhetoric is that the main goal of a Tableau story is to communicate insights through a compelling narrative. By illustrating the connections between natural disasters and refineries and their geographical impacts, we can effectively convey the significance of these relationships and show how the refineries located at the locations are susceptible to certain natural disasters and hence we can plan ahead and prepare for counter measures appropriately so there are no further dangers to the refinery. Because if proper counter measures are not taken, then there can be explosion at the refinery which can further be disastrous. Like the Fukushima nuclear reactor meltdown that happened in Japan after a serious earthquake hit.
